= Configure Clients

{productname} uses formulas with forms to configure your SAP clients.
There are two formulas with forms that you need to use: one to configure the HANA database, and one to configure the clients into a cluster.

The formulas are provided by a package called ``FIXME``.
When you have installed the package, you can use the {productname} {webui} to enable and configure the formulas.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The order that you enable and configure the formulas is important.
You must enable, configure, and apply the HANA formula first.
Then you can enable, configure, and apply the cluster formula.
If you perform these steps in the wrong order, your SAP installation will fail.
====


To install the SAP formulas, you need the SAP formulas package, which you can download from your package manager.
On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the ``saphanabootstrap-formula`` and ``habootstrap-formula`` packages with this command:

----
zypper in saphanabootstrap-formula
zypper in habootstrap-formula
----

When the installation is complete, restart services:

----
systemctl restart salt-master.service
----



== Enable and Configure the HANAÂ Formula

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and click the client you want to install the HANA formula on.
You should have two clients designated for the database, start with the primary client that you want to install the HANA database on, then repeat the process for the second client.

Navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab and check the ``FIXME`` formula in the list.
Click btn:``Save`` and apply the highstate to save the changes.

When the formula is applied, you can navigate to the menu:Formulas[HANA] tab, and complete the details in the form.
Make sure you ... FIXME

When you have completed all the details, click btn:``Save`` and apply the highstate.
When the highstate is complete, you can go on to apply the cluster formula.



== Enable and Configure the Cluster

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and click the ``FIXME`` client.
This is the FIXME.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab and check the ``FIXME`` formula in the list.
Click btn:``Save`` and apply the highstate to save the changes.

When the formula is applied, you can navigate to the menu:Formulas[Cluster] tab, and complete the details in the form.
Make sure you ... FIXME

Make sure that you provide the passwords for all the other clients you want included in the cluster.
Alternatively, you need to ensure that all of the clients can connect to each other directly using SSH.

When you have completed all the details, click btn:``Save`` and apply the highstate.
When the highstate is complete, your SAP cluster is ready to use.
