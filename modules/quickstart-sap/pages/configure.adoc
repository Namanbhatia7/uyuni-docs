= Configure Clients

Install the SAP Hana Deployment and SAP Cluster formulas.
Enable and configure the Hana formula first and apply the hightstate.
Then enable and configure the Cluster formula, and apply the highstate again.
Don't configure both and then apply the highstate for both, it will apply the formulas in the wrong order: Hana *must* be applied first.

Each node should be able to connect to other nodes using SSH. This is not mandatory, as the formulas works if you provide the other nodes password
