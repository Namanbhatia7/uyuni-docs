= Setting Up

Your SAP cluster requires several client systems.
Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have {sles}{nbsp}15 for SAP installation media ready on your {productname} Server.
You will not be able to create an SAP cluster without the {sles} SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP.

One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster.
Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection.
When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this.
For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP1/html/SLES4SAP-quick/cha-s4s-plan.html#sec-s4s-hardware



.Procedure: Registering Clients to the {SCC}
The minions must be connected to SCC (or must have the repositories with all the involved packages. We don't really support this 2nd statement, but it can be done).



.Procedure: Creating the Cluster
All the clustered machines must have the other cluster nodes name in /etc/hosts file (this must match with the node hostnames)



.Procedure: Creating a Shared Storage Device
The nodes must have a shared disk attached to use sbd fencing mechanism (this can be done with a real shared device, or via an iscsi service, that usually requires other extra machine hosting this service)


.Procedure: Downloading the SAP Installation Software
The SAP installation software must be available in all the nodes. So the software is not downloaded by the formulas. The location of the software must be the same in all nodes


.Procedure: Configuring Clients to Latest ``module.run``
// Not sure what this is. --LKB 2020-05-20
Minions must be configure to use the latest module.run version:
- 'use_superseded:'
      - '- module.run'



.Procedure: Install Additional Disks for Hana
The hana nodes must have an additional disk attached to store the files used by hana in /hana folder. More disks setups are possible, but 1 disk is required at least.



.Procedure: Registering Clients to the Server

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].
. In the [guimenu]``Host`` field, type the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the client to be bootstrapped.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Port`` field, type the SSH port number to use to connect and bootstrap the client.
By default, the SSH  port is [systemitem]``22``.
. In the [guimenu]``User`` field, type the username to log in to the client.
By default, the username is [systemitem]``root``.
. In the [guimenu]``Password`` field, type password to log in to the client.
. In the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` field, select the activation key that is associated with the software channel you want to use to bootstrap the client.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].
. OPTIONAL: In the [guimenu]``Proxy`` field, select the proxy to register the client to.
. By default, the [guimenu]``Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking`` checkbox is selected.
This allows the bootstrap process to automatically accept SSH host keys without requiring you to manually authenticate.
. OPTIONAL: Check the [guimenu]``Manage System Completely via SSH`` checkbox.
If you check this option, the client will be configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other connection method will be configured.
. Click btn:[Bootstrap] to begin registration.

When the bootstrap process has completed, your client will be listed at menu:Systems[System List].


[WARNING]
====
When new packages or updates are installed on the client using {productname}, any end user license agreements (EULAs) are automatically accepted.
To review a package EULA, open the package details page in the {webui}.
