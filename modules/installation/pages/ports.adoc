= Ports

This section contains a comprehensive list of ports that are used for various communications within {productname}.

You will not need to open all of these ports.
Some ports only need to be opened if you are using the service.

This image shows the main ports used in {productname}:

== External Server Ports

.External Port Requirements for {productname} Server
|===
| Port number | Direction | Protocol | Used By | Notes
| 67          | Inbound   | TCP/UDP  | DHCP    | Required when {productname} is configured as a DHCP server for systems requesting IP addresses.
| 69          | Inbound   | TCP/UDP  | TFTP | Used when {productname} is configured as a PXE server and allows installation and re-installation of PXE-boot enabled systems.
| 80          | Inbound   | TCP      | HTTP | Client and proxy server requests travel via HTTP or HTTPS.
Port 80 (http) is not used to serve the {webui}, and is closed in most installations.
Port 80 is used temporarily for some bootstrap repositories and automated installations.
| 80          | Outbound  | TCP      | HTTP | Used to contact {scc}/{ncc}.
| 443         | Inbound   | TCP      | HTTPS | All {webui}, client, and proxy server requests travel via HTTP or HTTPS.
| 443         | Outbound  | TCP      | HTTPS | {productname} uses this port to reach {scc} (unless running in a disconnected mode with RMT or SMT{mdash}as described in <<disconnect-setup>>)| 5222        | Inbound   | TCP      | osad  | When you wish to push actions to clients this port is required by the [systemitem]``osad`` daemon running on your client systems.
| 5269        | Inbound/Outbound | TCP | jabberd | Needed if you push actions to or via a {susemgrproxy}.
| 4505         | Inbound  | TCP | salt | Required by the Salt-master to accept communication requests via TCP from clients.
The connection is initiated by the client and remains open to allow the master to send commands.
This port uses a publish/subscribe topology; the client subscribes to notifications from the master.
| 4506        | Inbound  | TCP | salt | Required by the Salt-master to accept communication requests via TCP from clients.
The connection is initiated by the client and is open only when needed.
Usually, clients will open this port when they have to report results to the master, such as when a command received on port 4505 has finished.
This port uses a request/response topology; the client sends requests to the master.
| 25151        |         | TCP | Cobbler |
| 8050         | Inbound | TCP | websockify | Needed to access graphical console of virtual machines from {productname} web interface.

.Internal Port Requirements for {productname} Server
|===
| Port number | Notes
| 2828        | Satellite-search API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat and Taskomatic.
| 2829        | Taskomatic API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat.
| 6868        | Auditlog-keeper to database.
| 6888        | Auditlog-keeper API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat.
| 8005        | Tomcat shutdown port.
| 8009        | Tomcat to Apache HTTPD (AJP).
| 8080        | Tomcat to Apache HTTPD (HTTP).
| 9080        | Salt-API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat and Taskomatic.
| 32000       | Port for a TCP connection to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that runs Taskomatic and the search (satellite-search).

Anything from port 32768 on (more exactly, what you can see with [command]``cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range``) is an ephemeral port, typically used as the receiving end of a TCP connection.
So if process A opens a TCP connection to process B (for example, port 22), then A chooses an arbitrary source TCP port to match with destination port 22.



== External Proxy Ports

.External Port Requirements for {productname} Proxy
|===
| Port number | Direction | Protocol | Notes
| 22          | Inbound   |          |Required when using ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel contact methods.
Check-in on clients connected to a {productname} Proxy will be initiated on the {productname} Server and "`hop through`" through to clients.
| 80          | Outbound  |           | Used to reach {productname}.
| 4505         | Inbound  | TCP | salt | Required by the Salt-master to accept communication requests via TCP from clients.
The connection is initiated by the client and remains open to allow the master to send commands.
This port uses a publish/subscribe topology; the client subscribes to notifications from the master.
| 4506        | Inbound  | TCP | salt | Required by the Salt-master to accept communication requests via TCP from clients.
The connection is initiated by the client and is open only when needed.
Usually, clients will open this port when they have to report results to the master, such as when a command received on port 4505 has finished.
This port uses a request/response topology; the client sends requests to the master.
| 5222        | Inbound   | TCP       | For push actions and connections issued by [systemitem]``osad`` running on the client systems.
| 5269        | Inbound/Outbound | TCP | For push actions with the server.

| Port number | Direction | Protocol | Notes
| 22          | Inbound   | SSH      | Required when using ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel contact methods.
| 80          | Outbound  |          | To reach the {productname} server or {susemgrproxy} server.
| 5222        | Outbound  | TCP      | For push actions with the server or proxy server.
