= Service Pack Migration


Upgrading within a major {sls} version is fully automated.
For example, upgrading from {slea}{nbsp}12{nbsp}SP1 to {slea}{nbsp}12{nbsp}SP4.

[WARNING]
====
Before migrating to {slea}{nbsp}12{nbsp}SP3 or later, check which PostgreSQL versions you have installed.
The migration needs PostgreSQL 9.4 and 9.6 installed in parallel.
PostgreSQL 9.4 is only available in {sle} 12 SP2.
For more on upgrading the database, see xref:upgrade:db-migration.adoc[].
====

{suse} offers a graphical and command line tool for upgrading to a new service pack.
For instructions on how to complete this upgrade, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/cha_update_sle.html.
