.Procedure: Granting Root User Access

. On the client, edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file:
+
----
sudo visudo
----
+
Grant [command]``sudo`` access to the user by adding this line to the [filename]``sudoers`` file. Replace [systemitem]``<user>`` with the name of the user that will be used to bootstrap the client in the {webui}:
+
----
<user>  ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3
----

[NOTE]
====
This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client.
When the client is successfully installed it will run with root privileges, so the access is no longer required.
We recommend that you remove the line from the `sudoers` file after the client has been successfully installed.
