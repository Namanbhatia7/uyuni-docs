By default, the GPG key for {productname} client tools is not trusted.
The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted.
However, they will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them.

.Procedure: Trusting GPG Keys on Clients
. Add this key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter in all client bootstrap scripts:

----
uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key
----
. You do not need to delete any previously stored keys.
. OPTIONAL: If you are boostrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a salt state to trust the key.
Create the salt state and assign it to the organization.
You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients.
