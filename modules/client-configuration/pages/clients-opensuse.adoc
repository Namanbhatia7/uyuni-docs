= Registering openSUSE Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running {ubuntu} operating systems.

{productname} supports opensuse Leap 15 and 15.1 Clients using Salt.
// Traditional clients are not supported.

// [IMPORTANT]
// ====
// {suse} does not endorse or support {productname}.
// ====

Bootstrapping is supported for starting openSUSE clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.



== Prepare to Register

Some preparation is required before you can register {ubuntu} clients to the {productname} Server.

.Procedure: Adding the openSUSE Channels

. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, install the [systemitem]``spacewalk-utils`` package:
+
----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----
. Add the openSUSE channels.
For openSUSE Leap 15:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels \
opensuse_leap15_0 \
opensuse_leap15_0-non-oss \
opensuse_leap15_0-non-oss-updates \
opensuse_leap15_0-updates \
opensuse_leap15_0-uyuni-client
----
+
For openSUSE Leap 15.1:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels \
opensuse_leap15_1 \
opensuse_leap15_1-non-oss \
opensuse_leap15_1-non-oss-updates \
opensuse_leap15_1-updates \
opensuse_leap15_1-uyuni-client
----

. Synchronize the new custom channels.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need all the new channels fully synchronized before bootstrapping any openSUSE client.
openSUSE channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====

To synchronize, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], and for each channel you created, click it and:

. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories``.
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync``and click btn:[Sync Now] to begin synchronization immediately.

You can also setup a scheduled syncronization from this screen.

endif::[]

== Monitor Synchronization Progress

There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

// ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
// * In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``SUSE Products`` tab.
// +
// This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
// endif::[]
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], then click the channel associated to the repository.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories``, then [guimenu]``Sync`` and check [systemitem]``Sync Status``
endif::[]
* Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt with [command]``tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log``.
+
Each child channel will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.

You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.

== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

By default, openSUSE does not trust the GPG key for {productname} openSUSE client tools.
The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted.
However, they will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them.

To fix this, add this key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter in all openSUSE bootstrap scripts:
// CHECKIT
----
uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key
----

You do not need to delete any previously stored keys.

If you are boostrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key.
Create the salt state and assign it to the organization.
You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients.
endif::[]



== Register Clients

. To register your openSUSE clients, you will need a bootstrap repository.
Create the bootstrap repository at the command prompt, with this command:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
